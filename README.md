This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The error occurs when calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera has fully loaded.  The solution ensures the camera is ready before initiating picture capture.

**Problem:**
Calling `takePictureAsync` prematurely leads to an error because the camera is not yet initialized.

**Solution:**
The solution uses the `cameraRef`'s `current` property and a conditional check to ensure that the camera is ready before taking a picture.  Asynchronous operations are correctly handled to prevent race conditions.
